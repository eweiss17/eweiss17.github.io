                    <p>My Senior Design project was quite an ambitious one requiring knowledge in multiple software areas. Luckily I had three team members with different skills to help offset this load. The goal of our project was to create a smart mirror, in which you are able to select which widgets you want displayed on the mirror, as well as in which position. We decided to make an android app for easy selection of what appears on the mirror. A website was also added for those without Android phones.</p>

                    <p>This was the final product. The data being displayed on the mirror is taken from a mySQL database which connects the app and mirror with data. The mirror is built on Node.JS making calls to various API's based on what you selected on the app. </p><br>
